#Prologue
Author: Matteo Ferla ([email](matteo.ferla@gmail.com))

There is also a powerpoint presentation of my notes of the analysis.

These notes are written in markdown (like Reddit, Stack exchange, GitHub readme, etc., wiki markup is a precursor), but it is wrapped with Strapdown.js to make it an HTML. So they should be easy to edit.
If you nevertheless cannot figure it out while editing check out one of the many [md cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). This file also might use MathJax with $$$ for inline (my ad hoc hack).

##Locus names
In the work of other people in the lab the old locus tags may be in use. These were RTMOxxxxx. The new ones are Gthgxxxxx.
If you encounter a few and need a coversion, here is JS converter:

#Files
##Main files
<span style="color:red">I will put all files on the shared drive.</span> For now, you can find stuff [in my dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/scc3b84h96mxyxn/AADbzFVj6aAmTmlCVizHXd7ra?dl=0)
I have endevoured to store all the genomic information on the genbank file, `Gthg_TM242v3.0.gb`. There is also the model, `Gthg_2.2.xml` (SBML).
The information is easily mined but is not readily accessible without programming skills, so <span style="color:red">I'll add a set of spreadsheets with all the needed information</span>.
There are loads of programs that can deal with gb and SBML files.

A genbank file contains features such as cds each with various qualifiers. You have seen millions of these. For details of the controlled vocabulary see [specs](http://www.insdc.org/files/feature_table.html). 

An SBML file is an XML with various elements. Skim the [SBML specificiations online](http://sbml.org/Basic_Introduction_to_SBML). But in short the two main bits are the Species (as in chemical species):
```
<species id="M_1171_c"  name="3-Oxohexanoyl-[acp]_C17H29N2O9PRS" initialConcentration="1" compartment="Cytosol" boundaryCondition="false">
	<notes>
		<body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
			<html:p>FORMULA:  C17H29N2O9PRS</html:p>
			<html:p>CHARGE:  -1</html:p>
		</body>
	</notes>
</species>
```
And reactions which contain the gene association in COBRAtoolbox style. Gene-protein-association is poorly encoded in SBML.

```
I reccomend a decent text viewer Xcode (Mac) or Notepad++ (Win) as these will do nicely for basic searches of the gb and SBML files and the provide with code highlighting!
Please try checking them out, they are not as daungthing as they seem.
If unfamiliar with the new-line and return catridge problem in the three OSes, Google it.


##Python
I have have a [GitHub page](https://github.com/matteoferla/Geobacillus) with the python scripts I have used throughout this project.
I use Python 3.4. If you use Windows try Anaconda, it is way nicer to install. The IDE I use is PyCharm.

##R
I reccomend R studio in addition to R. To install libraries google install Bioconductor package. biocLite(). It is easy. 

##RNASeq
There are 12 sets of RNASeq datafiles. The Fastq are pair-ends. So 24 Fastq files in total. 
There is a xlsx labelled Raw something that sould have all the info you need. 

#Alignment in CLC
CLC Genomics is on the chromatography computer. It is a paid program, but it is handy. Alternatives include Bowtie and Cufflinks; and Rockhopper.  
It is imperative that you get an external HD. You have to set a workspace link in CLC to it, so you can save everythng. You cannot use the machine's HD due to the file sizes.
The program does not multithread, so load and then align multiple files at the same time.

1. Unzip the Fastq files.
2. Import the Illumina Pair-end fastq files with saving onto your ext HD. This will take a several hours. 
3. Toolbox for RNASeq mapping/aligning. I used the default parameters with save and report. The unmapped sequences are ribosomal in my case. See report pdfs. The broken pair scheme is so weirdo thing, ignore it.
4. Come back tomorrow
5. Save report as pdf, the pair mapped file as BAM (binary) or SAM (text, heavier, but you can fiddle with it...)
6. There are lots of csv table outputs. One of them has genes as rows and columns with counts and RPKM.

#Collate data in Excel
Assumed Excel knowledge (if not, google it): absolute references (F$1), named variables, vlookup, filter and pivot table. These will save your life.
Beware of my Excel files, some datasets may have filters on them grey funnel symbol on the header!
This is a simple task, but I'll go into detail just in case.
Gthg00001 to Gthg04743 will result in tRNA and no count genes giving NaN.
Do not risk doing a sloppy copy paste into a table as that may cause misaligned values!! Check `5 RNASeq map\RNASeq Raw.xlsx`.

1. Move all csv files as tabs into an excel. Get the gene column off one of the others spreadsheets. 
2. Make each dataset into a named variable and in the main tab add a column with `=vlookup(cell_address_with_absolute_column_$letter, dataset,field_number,FALSE)`.
3. For the R DESeq2 you will need Counts not RPKM. That will not work otherwise.
4. Save the xlsx, then save the trimmed down sheet save as a tsv to avoid Win new line issue with no spaces in header. DESeq2 R files has some notes about this if it does not work in DESeq2.

#DESeq2 Normalisation and significance calculations
I analysed the data in both R and MatLab to see what would be best for a simple protocol. Use R.

_Digression._ R and Matlab (and Haskell and Numpy) are similar. R is less friendly, but its syntax is closer to programming languages. MatLab is well, build, user friendly etc, but has less Bio packages.

In R (or R studio) check out my file `6 norm & sig\R norm and sig\RNASeq analysis.R`.
Copy it and modify it accordingly. You may need to install packages! If you are somehow struggling google it.

The bare minimum you can do is this. Please do more.
```
#Getting stuff
#Load library
library("DESeq2")
#if not installed, google it or bioconductor.
#chose the tsv file path
datafile=file.choose()
#make it a table instance
cds = read.table( datafile, header=TRUE, row.names=1)
#tell it what stuff is. Use your conditions obviously.
des=data.frame(row.names=colnames( cds),condition=c("UM5","UM5","UM1","UM1","UR5","UR5","UR1","UR1","AM5","AM5","AM1","AM1"),aerobicity=c("unaero","unaero","unaero","unaero","unaero","unaero","unaero","unaero","aero","aero","aero","aero"),richness=c("min","min","min","min","rich","rich","rich","rich","min","min","min","min"),speed=c("0.05/h","0.05/h","0.1/h","0.1/h","0.05/h","0.05/h","0.1/h","0.1/h","0.05/h","0.05/h","0.1/h","0.1/h"))

#Normalise the data for general comparisons.
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = cds, colData = des,design = ~ aerobicity)
#rld is regularised log2 of counts.
rld <- rlog(dds)
#save
write.csv(as.data.frame(assay(rld)),file="F:\\RNASeq\\R analysis\\1_rld.csv")

#Do analysis
#Choose the columns you want. if you want all just use cds and des and not cds[,1:8]
RvM <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = cds[,1:8], colData = des[1:8,],design = ~ richness)
#Delete the conditions you don't.
RvM$aerobicity <- droplevels(RvM$aerobicity)  
#Do this if you have multiple conditions to compare.
design(RvM) <-formula(~ richness + speed)
#Do the analysis
RvM <-DESeq(RvM)
resR <-results(RvM, contrast =c("richness","rich","min"))
write.csv(as.data.frame(resR),file="F:\\RNASeq\\R analysis\\1_rich.csv")
```

So in the csv you will have:
* Log2 fold change between of the contrast you asked for: `contrast =c("richness","rich","min")` means you are comparing along the richness condition axis, the FC will be the change from min to rich.
* Log2 SE.
* negative binomial GLM fitted p-values and BH-adjusted p-values.

If you need to do operations with the log2s remember they are logarithms, so don't do geometric means, just regular averages (arithmetic mean)

##Analysis in Excel
There are loads of things you can do.

###Biggest changers
One of these is sorting by biggest changers.
The gene locus tag is cryptic so use the vlookup trick to port more data, such as product or pathway.
Then apply the filter to sort.
If you are unfamiliar with the gene, google it. You'll quickly see trends.

###Enrichment analysis
Pivot tables of certain categorical values can give you other indications of trends. I do my boxplots in matlab, but I think Excel does them.
A $$$ \chi ^2 $$$ test is what you need to compare stuff. A one sample $$$ \chi ^2 $$$ test (simplify the table as is and is't that give category).
I found this avenue of enquiry unsatisfying due to poor categorical qualities. This might change the more I port stuff from the SBML file. KEGG mapping was more satfiying.

###Kegg mapping
The most useful thing is [mapping the sequences to KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html). In my files there is a list with duplicates of loci and the KEGG rxn ids they do.<span style="color:red">make dummy file?</span>
In my notes there is some digression on possible colour choices. Be warned that the homologues may cause issues.

###Homologues with different behaviour
Compare homologues of the same gene is very useful. <span style="color:red">I will set up a dummy sheet for this.</span>

###Circos
If you want to plot your data in Circos. It is a pain to use.

* Install everything as they say on the manual! It does not install dependencies, you have to do it.
* Google their manual.
* check out my conf files. They are set up for Geo.
  * Just change the line in circos.conf to chr.txt/chr1.txt/chr2.txt for each replicon.
  * The files aero and rich which dictate the histograph have been divided by 10 as the limits of the axis are set to (-1,1).
  * The gene positions are doctored to not overlap. You'll find these in several of my Xlsx sheets.

###Operon of interest
I use GenomeDiagram module in Python's BioPython package. <span style="color:red">MacVector? Pen and paper?</span>
 
###Saving notes and changes to the genbank file and model
<span style="color:red">I haven't really though about this outside of Python and Biopython. Maybe tinker with stuff in notepad++?</span>

###Blasting genes
You may find one or more genes of interest on the internet. To find it's homologue install blast+.
Two database sets are provided: protein of TM242 and replicons. They were made with makeblastdb as you cannot use `-subject` argument if there is more than one subject (it will discard the rest).
In the terminal (Mac) or cmd (Win) navigate to the folder:
```
blastp -query protein_of_interest.fasta -db TM242_prot.fa -out align.txt
```
You can get different outputs with `-outfmt` (5 is XML for BioPython).

###Imcompleteness
If you are reading this note it means I have not finished what I was hoping to do:
* Modify the gb
  * with all my notes
  * with repeat_region features of cripr
  * misc_feature features for the islands
  * operon features from Rockhopper
  * xrefdb with Kegg data from SBML file

            <p>Gram-positive, motile rods 0.5–1.2×3.0–7.0 µm. Short ellipsoidal to cylindrical endospores are borne subterminally and terminally
               and occasionally swell the sporangia. Facultatively anaerobic. Colonies on TSA are 0.5 to 5 mm in diameter, flat, smooth,
               translucent, glossy, circular and entire, and faintly brown in colour after 50 °C incubation for 24–48 h. Viscid pellicles
               are formed in broth. Optimum growth at 50 °C; no growth at 37 or 60 °C. Optimum growth at pH 8, weak growth at pH 7 and 9,
               and no growth at pH 6. Tolerates up to 0.5 % NaCl. Catalase-positive, oxidase weakly positive. Aesculin is hydrolysed, casein
               is not. Starch hydrolysis is variable and weak when positive. Citrate is not utilized; arginine dihydrolase, hydrogen sulphide,
               indole, lysine decarboxylase, tryptophan deaminase and urease production are negative; and the Voges–Proskauer test and nitrate
               reduction are variable. Acid without gas is produced from cellobiose,
